This repository contains a **Python + Streamlit** implementation of the classic **Monty Hall problem** — a famous probability puzzle inspired by a game show scenario.  
Through this simulation, you can **experiment**, **visualize outcomes**, and **understand why switching doors statistically increases your chances of winning**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🎮 **Interactive** Monty Hall game simulation  
- 📊 **Visual representation** of the game mechanics  
- 🔄 Option to **switch** or **stay** with your initial choice  
- 📈 Real-time calculation of **win rates** for both strategies  
- 🧪 Ability to run multiple simulations and observe statistical patterns

## 📌 Example Output
When you run the app, a Streamlit web interface will open in your browser where you can:
- Pick a door 🏠  
- Decide whether to switch 🔄  
- See results and win percentages 📊
